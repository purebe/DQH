EVENT SYSTEM.

BUILDINGS/RESEARCHES/ETC

HP BARS FOR UNITS

Zombies focus fighters, then druids, then books.

pacing of game needs to be decided by and balanced by the way that the cost for researches and upgrades scales.

RESARCHES:

ROW 1 COL 3: BOOKS ARE STRONGER (each upgrade is +1 hit from a zombie, EXPENSIVE)

ROW 2 COL 2: DRUID SPEED (druid velocity +0.5)

ROW 3 COL 3: DRUID LIFE (+1 hit from a zombie, EXPENSIVE)

ROW 3 COL 1: A HERO IS BORN (expensive, fighter spawn rate)

ROW 3 COL 2: FIGHTER ENDURANCE (fighter velocity +0.1) (+life)

ROW 3 COL 3: FIGHTER DAMAGE (+damage)

EVENTS:

Zombie Mania (mass zombie spawns)

Zombie boss spawns

Golden eggs spawn (worth lots of cash, but druids fear them so they won't collect them)

when you upgrade spawn rates for druid/fighter, you also spawn 1x druid/fighter (maybe modulated by the research level)
